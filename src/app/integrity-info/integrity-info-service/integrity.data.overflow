    "COMMENTS": "USACEs comments re: Complexity, Quality, Schedule, Mgmt. & Reg. Compliance are untrue. Cherokee (CGC) disagrees with all USACEs representations in this eval. CGC responded to the USACE Show Cause letter on 05 June 2017, detailing a plan forward and addressing the out of contract obstacles, as well as providing a recovery schedule. USACEs statement that no schedule was provided is untrue.  CGC received no reply or request for additional information or action from USACE following its Show Cause response.  CGC had requested USACE direction for several pending Contract Mods prior to its response, and again after its response, so that presented plan could be executed.  It is well documented by CGC that USACE was unable to provide the requested direction or Mods, which delayed the project outside the control of CGC.  Ultimately and without reasonable discussions with CGC or CGCs surety, USACE elected to wrongfully terminate the project, expressing schedule urgency as the primary reason for moving to re-procure the work.  It is CGCs understanding that, to date, USACE has not re-procured the project or responded to CGCs Suretys requests to mitigate damages and complete the project.  It is also CGCs understanding that USACE has proceeded with re-procurement using CGCs final design documents, which include significant work that was never made part of CGCs contract (crowned runway, addl. drainage material layer, drainage infrastructure and unsuitable soil remediation). CGC maintains the position that the project lacked the proper planning and correct funding by USACE, and USACE has improperly terminated CGCs Contract, causing significant financial damages to a small disadvantaged business. The fact that USACEs evaluation makes no mention of the impact of its significant project scope increases during design or the differing site conditions encountered with unsuitable soils is shocking. As such, CGC is proceeding with appealing the improper default termination decision."

This was a one person contract with a value of $6,800.00.  We had made a genuine effort to find a qualified individual in the UK and spent over $700.00 in the effort.  The US Government complaint was made by a Contracting Officer at RAF Croughton, UK, who falsely determined that we had not responded to his correspondence.  His complaint made its ways to the Dept of the Air Force.  We have the documentation to show that we did respond to all correspondence regarding the performance of this contract.  We believe that the PPIRS record should be corrected and the entry changed to read Termination for Convenience."

    "COMMENTS": "Benkari LLC elected to not sign the final extension for this contract. Benkari is able to perform the scope of work as it did the initial year and 2 option years. COR was satisfied with service provided. The issues that led us to make the difficult decision follow. \n\nMEPCOM significantly altered the HVAC systems we were contractually bound to maintain without notice including installation of a new controls system by another contractor. This chang led to a spike in compressor failures and other calls which Benkari promptly responded to. To date, the Government has not compensated Benkari. The CO states it was out of our contract and should not have been performed. This is a gray area that left Benkari having provided extra service worth over $15,000. The COR stated to Benkari management multiple times that payment for the work performed in Q4 2016 and Q1 2017 was approved but it has not been paid as of 7/23/2018. \n\nCOR requested Benkari provide quotes to provide maintenance of controls and replace defunct Carrier chiller but never followed up. Benkari provided documentation proving the chiller is beyond its useful life and must be replaced. It cannot be repaired and does not constitute a sufficient backup for data center cooling system. The controls proposal was requested to ensure there was one point of contact for the HVAC system instead of two separate contractors. COR never followed up. Upon request, we will provide emails demonstrating our attempts to resolve these issues and lack of response from client. On our last phone call with COR, he stated  they were pleased with our service over the first 3 years. We were happy to serve MEPCOM and hope this Termination will not damage our ability to perform future federal work. We are a small business that responds to clients but we cant afford to perform $15,000+ in free work, be held responsible for other contractors work/a clients inability to communicate, or attempt to maintain equipment well past its useful life."

    "COMMENTS": "TRG disputes the agency’s Partial T4D, issued 80 days after TRG successfully completed work. The terminated services are related to a one-month (January 2020) Continuity of Services clause, 52.237-3. Above and beyond phase-out, TRG continued normal mission requirements, completing about 150 flights, 900 simulator events, and 550 classes in January. The COR on four occasions confirmed TRG completed these services, yet the ACO repeatedly directed him to reject all invoices. To further confirm the services we furnished, TRG provided 14 documents to accompany our 13-page Show Cause response, yet the CO still determined that absolutely no services were performed and removed all $2.15M funding from the FFP CLIN after the fact. Notably, January completed 46 months of TRG services, which were rated “Exceptional” in every area of the government’s scoring. Indeed, the CO herself praised TRG, writing “Your company has performed exceptionally.” The successor even expressed its appreciation for our help. The ACO also commended TRG by asking about extending our contract six months on 14JAN2020 but refused to negotiate rates, mandating TRG use 2015 rates. When TRG could not accept these CBA-non-compliant rates, the agency issued a bridge contract on 31JAN2020 to another contractor, agreeing to pay $3.45M MORE for five months than TRG’s submitted price. TRG protested to the agency, which it dismissed. TRG then protested to the GAO causing the Agency to take Corrective Action, which created a gap in services from 13FEB2020 to 10MAR2020. The T4D soon followed. The agency notified TRG 10MAR2020 that a Notice of Default would be issued “tomorrow” and suggested we could submit a claim. It is clear the “default” decision was predetermined before issuance of the Show Cause on 12MAR2020 and the Agency ignored our response. TRG disputes this erroneous decision and will seek judicial review."

We were unable to obtain funding, to meet the modified terms; because of this, the manufacturer cancelled the order, and we were not capable to deliver the equipment, as ordered.\n\n\n\nThe solicitation was issued to buy exclusively one model of equipment.  We believe that the price received from the manufacturer, was so the presentation of proposals will look competed, they were not expecting that we would be aggressive on our proposal.  They had planned to receive the award through a company associated with their Government sales division.\n\n\n\nWe kept the Government completely informed, of all the steps we followed, trying to get the requested finance.\n\n\n\nWe can show other multi-million dollar Government contracts and projects, we have worked on, where credit from manufacturers and contract performance, have not been an issue."

    "COMMENTS": "Fidelity disagrees strongly with the decision to terminate for default Contract No. W56HZV-13-C-0052 for alleged failure to make progress that endangers overall performance. We delivered 2,343 of 2,822 Heavy B-Kits from date of award. All delivered kits were inspected and accepted by the agency. In August 2018, a component supplier cancelled its contract with us causing us to request a delivery extension from the agency. We found another supplier and timely sought agency approval as part of our plan to mitigate schedule impact. Concurrent with the requested supplier approval, DCMA conducted a review and incorrectly determined that a corrosion test was required. We were precluded from delivering kits while we sought clarity from the agency on the applicability of the corrosion test. Three months later, the agency agreed that the corrosion test was unclear, approved the shipment of 5 completed kits and stated that it would modify the contract and issue a RFP to add a new corrosion requirement on all remaining kits. The agency provided neither a contract modification nor RFP for the new requirement and instead issued a cure notice to which we responded and sought cooperation from the agency on developing a plan to cure the delay and deliver the remaining kits. The agency then terminated the contract. But for DCMA’s erroneous contract interpretation, the program would not have been unnecessarily delayed by the agency. In the cure notice, the termination notice, and the CPAR rating, there is no mention that the agency had any responsibility in the unnecessary delay. We are invoking our right to challenge this improper termination. Since the decision has not yet been reviewed under the Contract Disputes Act, it is unreasonable and punitive for the agency to issue an interim CPAR rating before its decision is final. We have been a defense contractor for 31 years and we have never had a contract terminated.  We intend to continue serving America’s warfighters."

    "COMMENTS": "This was an unfortunate situation.  Eskridge & Associates was approached by the COR and asked if we would be interested in bidding on a follow-on contract for four incumbent Psychiatrists.  We were lead to believe that all four were interested in staying on the assignment.  As all were in the local area, travel funds were not authorized.  Unfortunately, we quickly learned that none of the four incumbents wished to stay.  I went back to the KO and requested the travel funds as we had providers who would be interested but none were local.  The Army declined stating we should have requested the funds in the beginning!  In spite of our best efforts, we recruited very heavily for the four positions unsuccessfully.  We did have some interested candidates but with the issues they had, they would not pass credentialing.  We kept the KO and COR informed on a weekly basis of our progress.  Unfortunately, we just could not make it work.  Because of our level of effort, the KO and COR recommended that the contract be cancelled for convenience.  Unfortunately, the legal folks disagreed and entered a term for default.  We protested and agreed to accept the term for default if the Army would not hold us financially responsible for any follow on contracts...they agreed.  We have other psychiatry contracts with the VA with exceptional and very good CPAR ratings showing our capabilities.  I truly regret that this happened and take it very personally, as Eskridge prides itself on performance and adhering to the terms of every contract.  My goal for my company is to help get our servicemen and veterans the help they need and deserve...period! I sincerely hope that we are able to support our troops at Ft Hood in the future."

    "COMMENTS": "Assist Consultants, Inc. was recently terminated for default by the Transatlantic Middle East District over a dispute with the contracting officer as to the adequacy of performance and payment bonds being offered by Assist. The sole reason for the termination was the contracting officer’s refusal to accept bonds issued by a non-Treasury Circular 570 listed surety.  \n\nAssist’s actual performance up to the date of termination was never questioned.   Prior to this termination, Assist had been awarded 30 separate task orders/contracts from USACE with a value of $190 Million. Of those 30 contracts, all but 4 were performed in Afghanistan. The remaining 4 were awarded by the USACE Europe District for work in Africa. All of these contracts were completed, without claims. ACI has shown itself to be a competent, valuable partner to USACE in its Middle East construction projects with an excellent performance history."

    "COMMENTS": "This termination is incorrect and unfair. The vehicles required the USG were provided on time. The vehicles registrations could not be found on the Ministry of Interior website which made the COR reject the vehicles. We explained to them that the vehicles were government owned and they are not updated on the website. We had provided registration details which showed they were valid. Even after talking to the ACO our vehicles were lying outside the base for 12 days and after that we received this termination. After complaining to the Qatar Government about this, they provided us with the certificate on December 24, 2019. We provided this certificate to the COR in Qatar and have not heard any response back. We did all this to prove MASC only provides quality service and wanted the government to feel that MASC has provided the vehicles as per the PWS."

    "COMMENTS": "This comment is made for the appeal to the Government removing information due to the following reasons;  \n\n\n\nI. HANBOO has successfully performed the US contracts as the prime contractor and improved the performance to meet the requirements of Government. However, regarding the subject W91QVN14D00430030 the minor submittals failure such as AF 3000 on HVAC system and domestic hot water generator was led to the determination on the termination for default.  \n\n\n\nII. Hanboo assured that we would be able to complete the project within CCD (11 September 2016), and insisted that the termination for default should be retracted, allowing Hanboo to resume performance on the subject project.\n\n\n\nIII. The U.S. government and Hanboo held a meeting on January 20, 2016 and Hanboo needs to meet deadlines for certain works and also summarizing a list of documents. \n\n- Hanboo submitted all the documents the U.S. government required to be submitted by January 27, 2016, except for AF 3000 for HVAC system and domestic hot water generator.  Hanboo, however, clearly explained in their letter that due to the offshore supplier’s not being able to provide data on time. \n\n\n\nVI. However, without giving any reason for the suspension, the Government suspended the work on 28 January, 2016, and the termination for default action was taken on 25 February, 2016 purely on the basis that Hanboo failed to AF 3000 on HVAC system and domestic hot water generator on January 27, 2016.\n\n\n\nV. Even though Hanboo has constantly tried to contact Contracting Officer via phone and emails and meet face to face though, she was keeping off our trial and did not respond to any emails.\n\n\n\nHanboo requests for removal of information because the U.S. government’s unilateral suspension and termination without any further discussion is wrongful and improper."

    "COMMENTS": "A contract that has been fully and timely completed, as is the case here, can’t be terminated 10 months after that fact. This contract was successfully fulfilled on 3/27/17.  Axxon is still owed a remaining $14.1K for CLIN 3, because as proven below, it was completed and the pumps installed on 3/1/17. Devaluation by USACE of the $14.1K balance still owing for CLIN 3, and the contract overall, is improper  -and must be restored to invoiceable status, so that Axxon can be paid this money that is rightly owed by USACE. Axxon respectfully requests that the termination be rescinded, and that a cancellation notice for contract mod P0003, the added work not done then be issued. On 3/27/17, Axxon received sub’s invoice for completion of CLINS 02 thru 06, thus finishing all SOW, for the Contract. From 11/8/17 to 12/19/17, Axxon sent 3 requests for site visits, for new firms to complete the P00003 added work, which were turned-down.  CLIN 3 is alleged by USACE to have been “accepted and paid in full”, on 3/8/17, based upon Axxon’s invoice dated 3/1/17. That invoice was in fact paid in full, but it didn’t include the still owing $14.1K for CLIN 3, which was rejected by the USACE’s Mr. Murphy, because the training on the pump had yet to be done  -but was done 19 days later, per wishes of USACE, and the 2nd, and final invoice was received from our sub the next day including completion of CLIN 3. As such there is  still an outstanding $14.1K for CLIN 3. Our sub’s purchase order requires “government acceptance” of all CLIN work, before it becomes due. CLIN 03 remains at present, not only unaccepted, but USACE, is also wrongly deobligating 10% of its’ value. Contract officer Taylor cites  ”failure to provide accelerated payments to small business subcontractors”.  Our request for progress payments was under “either FAR 52.232-14, or FAR 52.232–16”. Axxon never asked for payment under FAR 52.232-40, as cited by contract officer Taylor."

It is unsupported by the facts and by applicable legal precedent. The decision is being challenged including appeal to the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals.\n\nThe notice of T4D is infected with several informational deficiencies: \n\n(1) EM-385-1-1: At no time did KCC ever state it was not applicable to this project, let alone that it was not applicable due to the project being on a Naval base.\n\n (2) BAA: NAVFAC incorrectly alleged that a custom valve box was foreign. The custom valve box was documented as domestic.  NAVFAC accepted all BAA remedial actions and corresponding materials.\n\n(3) OSHA Citation: OHSA did not issue any citations or warnings; KCCs record reflects this on the OSHA website. \n\n(4) QC Reports: KCC was not notified of any missing QC reports, nor does the T4D notice identify any alleged days that reports were not submitted or missing.\n\n(5) Payrolls: All employees have been paid the certified wage required by the contract documents. The Superintendent is not required to be paid certified wages.\n\nThe notice of T4D fails to mention NAVFACs improper calculation of the completion date due to excusable delays and failed to consider its multiple suspensions of work without time extensions and improper assessment of LDs during same.\n\nNAVFAC improperly withheld payment for assessment of LDs during the period of performance in anticipation of termination. NAVFAC breached its duty of good faith and fair dealing by refusing to cooperate, partner, and timely respond, all which hindered KCCs performance. This objectionable conduct and improper motive is an abuse of discretion by the KO to terminate the contract."

A Termination for Default is an extreme remedy and inappropriate in this circumstance. We are not responsible for the majority of the problems that occurred during performance. The delays were due to differing site conditions, a matter wholly outside of our control. The vertical and horizontal dimensions differed materially from the contract drawings, and those differences substantially impacted performance. The subsurface conditions were not discoverable during the design phase. \n\n\n\nDespite these challenges, we worked with the Government to develop a solution and complete the project. The alleged quality control issues were primarily due to incorrect interpretation of requirements and personnel disputes. A neutral third party would undoubtedly conclude that our work met the contract requirements. Furthermore, the Government directed us to perform in a manner inconsistent with the specifications. We used our best efforts to explain our position to the Government and come to a mutually agreeable outcome, but we were often unsuccessful. Again, this was not because of our lack of abilities as a federal contractor. We have a strong past performance record and have received favorable CPARs from multiple customers. \n\n\n\nFor these reasons, the CPAR and default termination do not accurately reflect our performance. We are confident that our appeal will be successful, and the Termination for Default will be converted to a Termination for Convenience."

I spoke to them and they\n\nsuggested I request a change if you must report it as contract termination of\n\nconvenience\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a long consuming process and I offered  pricing On the nine items requested I delivered 7 as requested and 1/2 of teeshirts due to screeners misprint. I submitted metal for cell phone attachment. That piece I thought was impossible but Damian showed me a website to order sample, which I did I found after a long search a company to do prototype , which was excepted by Damian, however the company took an\n\nextremely long time to do blister packing. Most companies will not do samples\n\nunless it is a live order, However no response, so I assumed no interest\n\nbecause of lateness. )That company still calls to see if there was any\n\nfeedback)\n\n\n\n\n\nAll in all $205,000 of the 255,000 was delivered and accepted. $48,000\n\ndeducted fro misprint of shirts and about $5,00 for no interest because of\n\nlateness of cell phone attachment.\n\n\n\n\n\nStephanie I have requested and will continue to request a letter stating\n\nrejection of teeshirts If you are unable t provide please point me to the\n\ncorrect person.\n\n\n\n\n\nI hope the admission recruits enjoyed products delivered.\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain please consider removing termination letter or changing to termination\n\nbecause of convenience hank you"

The basics of our disagreement are as follows:\n\n-\tRAVCO’s subcontractor contracted the contracting officer directly (via their attorney) to complain and cast disparaging inferences toward RAVCO regarding their subcontract. We believe that this unauthorized subcontractor-to-contracting officer contact – with disparaging information – was instrumental in the contracting officer’s determination to issue Termination for Cause.\n\n-\tThe contracting officer, via email, noted that RAVCO had not satisfactorily performed on the contract “within the first year” of the contract, yet this period was only a few months (not a full year). In addition, RAVCO was never allowed to execute “cure plan” specifics – as coordinated with the direct supported customer – within the full contract (multi-year) period. RAVCO’s cure was multi-year focused, but the contracting officer cited non-performance “within the first year” without a full year having expired.\n\n-\tRAVCO was required by contact to engage with the supported customer and develop a plan – and cure plan – to execute within a multi-year effort. However, once RAVCO executed the required contact with the supported customer and developed the cure plan, we forwarded this to the contracting officer. The contacting officer denied the plan and cited non-performance “within the first year” – not allowing a multi-year cure per our customer-coordinated plan."

The company began miscommunicating and failing to meet delivery dates. As early as January 6th, 2015, communication was initiated with MS. Glenda Stitts, our DLA contracting officer to voice our concern. Numerous attempts were made to address the situation, to include traveling to their facility in California for hands-on engagement and substantial financial assistance to secure materials. However, efforts to move forward were proving to be unproductive and ineffective, all the while communicating the circumstances to DLA. In April of 2015, Roger Reyes and Rosa Reyes traveled to Richmond, VA., to meet and consult with our contracting officers; Mr. Anthony Gray, Ms. Glenda Stitts, Mr. Howard Brown, where the impending situation with this vendor was discussed. We pressed forward into an arduous campaign to find other manufacturers to fulfilled the outstanding orders. Consequently, on June 26th, 2015, we were left with no remedy but to submit a list of contract orders (same as listed in FAPIIS) to DLA requesting their cancellation, although well before their delivery due dates of 2016 and 2017.

The decision to label as “Termination for Default” and wording used, is undeserved, when measured against our actions. SDV Recon notified DLA well in advance, traveled to meet with TRI-WIND, DLA officials (as mentioned above) and maintained communication thru out. Our handling of the situation shows we were committed and determined to follow-thru with our commitment. \n\nAlthough an unsuccessful outcome, SDV Recon performed accordingly and beyond."

The company began miscommunicating and failing to meet delivery dates. As early as January 6th, 2015, communication was initiated with MS. Glenda Stitts, our DLA contracting officer to voice our concern. Numerous attempts were made to address the situation, to include traveling to their facility in California for hands-on engagement and substantial financial assistance to secure materials. However, efforts to move forward were proving to be unproductive and ineffective, all the while communicating the circumstances to DLA. In April of 2015, Roger Reyes and Rosa Reyes traveled to Richmond, VA., to meet and consult with our contracting officers; Mr. Anthony Gray, Ms. Glenda Stitts, Mr. Howard Brown, where the impending situation with this vendor was discussed. We pressed forward into an arduous campaign to find other manufacturers to fulfilled the outstanding orders. Consequently, on June 26th, 2015, we were left with no remedy but to submit a list of contract orders (same as listed in FAPIIS) to DLA requesting their cancellation, although well before their delivery due dates of 2016 and 2017. Shortly after TRI-WIND ESI closed for business.\n\nOrders posted in FAPIIS, depict a negative and lack-off performance by SDV Recon. The decision to label as “Termination for Default” and wording used, is undeserved, when measured against our actions. SDV Recon notified DLA well in advance, traveled to meet with TRI-WIND, DLA officials (as mentioned above) and maintained communication thru out. Our handling of the situation shows we were committed and determined to follow-thru with our commitment. \n\nAlthough an unsuccessful outcome, SDV Recon performed accordingly and beyond."

Consequently, on June 26th, 2015, we were left with no remedy but to submit a list of contract orders (same as listed in FAPIIS) to DLA requesting their cancellation, although well before their delivery due dates of 2016 and 2017.

The company began miscommunicating and failing to meet delivery dates. As early as January 6th, 2015, communication was initiated with MS. Glenda Stitts, our DLA contracting officer to voice our concern. Numerous attempts were made to address the situation, to include traveling to their facility in California for hands-on engagement and substantial financial assistance to secure materials. However, efforts to move forward were proving to be unproductive and ineffective, all the while communicating the circumstances to DLA. In April of 2015, Roger Reyes and Rosa Reyes traveled to Richmond, VA., to meet and consult with our contracting officers; Mr. Anthony Gray, Ms. Glenda Stitts, Mr. Howard Brown, where the impending situation with this vendor was discussed. We pressed forward into an arduous campaign to find other manufacturers to fulfilled the outstanding orders. Consequently, on June 26th, 2015, we were left with no remedy but to submit a list of contract orders (same as listed in FAPIIS) to DLA requesting their cancellation, although well before their delivery due dates of 2016 and 2017. Shortly after TRI-WIND ESI closed for business.\n\nOrders posted in FAPIIS, depict a negative and lack-off performance by SDV Recon. The decision to label as “Termination for Default” and wording used, is undeserved, when measured against our actions. SDV Recon notified DLA well in advance, traveled to meet with TRI-WIND, DLA officials (as mentioned above) and maintained communication thru out. Our handling of the situation shows we were committed and determined to follow-thru with our commitment. \n\nAlthough an unsuccessful outcome, SDV Recon performed accordingly and beyond."

However, efforts to move forward were proving to be unproductive and ineffective, all the while communicating the circumstances to DLA. In April of 2015, Roger Reyes and Rosa Reyes traveled to Richmond, VA., to meet and consult with our contracting officers; Mr. Anthony Gray, Ms. Glenda Stitts, Mr. Howard Brown, where the impending situation with this vendor was discussed. We pressed forward into an arduous campaign to find other manufacturers to fulfilled the outstanding orders. Consequently, on June 26th, 2015, we were left with no remedy but to submit a list of contract orders (same as listed in FAPIIS) to DLA requesting their cancellation, although well before their delivery due dates of 2016 and 2017.

Based on our prior experience and our country representative’s recommendations, at least 3 days were required because of (1) local road conditions, (2) equipment transportation safety concerns, and (3) advance Ugandan Police coordination requirements. The earth moving bulldozers had to be transported from Camp Singo to Kampala, modified in Kampala, and transported back to Camp Singo. As the contracting officer indicated, our company attempted to accommodate this requirement but was unable to do so in 24 hours."

    "COMMENTS": "Our company made timely arrangements to deliver the NTVs but required the VAT form before the delivery to avoid paying an additional 20% tax or $13,740. Based on our company’s prior experiences in other countries in Europe and our understanding of the SOFA, we expected to receive the VAT form before the delivery or have the tax included in the contract price. Our request for the VAT form before the delivery was interpreted as our inability to deliver. Based on this experience, we amended our policies to always ensure timely delivery of all supplies and services to the U.S. Government, hired more experienced personnel, and perform in accordance with the FAR."

    "COMMENTS": "On March 16, 2016, Air Force Research Lab (AFRL)/RIKO determined that delivery of IT products on contract # FA8732-14D-0004, D.O. #RX30 had been extensively delayed, which resulted in contract termination due to noncompliance of delivery.  After the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) PCI Systems Inc. (PCI) in Sunnyvale, Ca. missed the initial delivery date, Sterling contacted PCI to obtain an updated delivery date. Sterling also informed AFRL both verbally and in writing of delivery issues stemming from PCI. PCI had given Sterling and AFRL several delivery dates; none were met. \n\nPCI’s owner, Claus Gross, later informed Sterling that the product was incorrectly shipped on March 08, 2016, to Northrop Grumman (NG) who also had a contract with AFRL. Sterling immediately notified the AFRL contracting office. Sterling also reached out to NG to transfer official custody of the equipment to ensure that other AFRL projects dependent on it were not delayed. Sterling then provided the AFRL contracting office with an action plan delineating the options for AFRL to take possession of the equipment or return it to Sterling’s possession.\n\nAfter the extensive delay on the equipment, Sterling enacted a strict policy of vetting new OEMs. Sterling confirms the new OEM’s location, references, and prior history. If a company cannot be verified, Sterling will not enter into an agreement with them."

    "COMMENTS": "This order was cancelled by the customer on 4-28-17 after a confluence of events that started with the customer submitting the order to an incorrect email address for someone that did not even work at NCS at the time. Further, they did not confirm with NCS that the order was received nor did they go thru the approved and established method of order submission via the CHESS EMart website. This is a prime example of what happens when someone does not follow the established and approved Government procurement process. This was corroborated by Major Miner on 5-10-17 via the CPAR for this order. By the time this was discovered the established Consolidate Buy pricing under the ADMC2 contract was no longer available. The customer was given the option to amend the order with the existing Consolidated Buy pricing at the time however they were non-communicative at this point and did not provide NCS with the authorization to proceed at the amended price. As such NCS was at a point where we could go no further without approval from the customer. NCS worked diligently with the customer to get them to approve the new pricing which they never did. After weeks of trying to work with this customer they finally cancelled the order. As such this Termination for Default is unwarranted and NCS is formally demanding that it be rescinded. All of this is documented in a CPAR dated 5-10-17 as well as email communication and is available upon request. If the customer had followed the ADMC2/CHESS procurement process they would not have had any of these issues and they would have their items for almost a year by now. I remain available to discuss this matter with any interested party."
